A prerequisite for such systems to operate adequately is the capability to reliably and efficiently transfer information across multiple modules. Here, we study the features enabling a robust transfer of stimulus representations in modular networks of spiking neurons, tuned to operate in a balanced regime. To capitalize on the complex, transient dynamics that such networks exhibit during active processing, we apply reservoir computing principles and probe the systems' computational efficacy with specific tasks. Focusing on the comparison of random feed-forward connectivity and biologically inspired topographic maps, we find that, in a sequential set-up, structured projections between the modules are strictly necessary for information to propagate accurately to deeper modules. Such mappings not only improve computational performance and efficiency, they also reduce response variability, increase robustness against interference effects, and boost memory capacity. We further investigate how information from two separate input streams is integrated and demonstrate that it is more advantageous to perform non-linear computations on the input locally, within a given module, and subsequently transfer the result downstream, rather than transferring intermediate information and performing the computation downstream. Depending on how information is integrated early on in the system, the networks achieve similar task-performance using different strategies, indicating that the dimensionality of the neural responses does not necessarily correlate with nonlinear integration, as predicted by previous studies. These findings highlight a key role of topographic maps in supporting fast, robust, and accurate neural communication over longer distances. Given the prevalence of such structural feature, particularly in the sensory systems, elucidating their functional purpose remains an important challenge toward which this work provides relevant, new insights. At the same time, these results shed new light on important requirements for designing functional hierarchical spiking networks.","tags":["Modularity","Information transfer","Stimulus representation"],"title":"Passing the message: Representation transfer in modular balanced networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renato Duarte"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1558447200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577918688,"objectID":"6e7cdabd34d4256ed8dc4bda9c01ca85","permalink":"https://rcfduarte.github.io/talk/shonan/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/shonan/","section":"talk","summary":"Several organizational principles of the neocortex appear to imply a strong predisposition to acquire temporal structure in a completely incidental/unsupervised manner, a process that is central to many core aspects of cognition.

We test the ability of networks to discriminate their input as a function of the number of distinct input symbols. We also compare performance using either membrane potentials or filtered spike trains as state variable.

As such, neural computation and the properties of functional neurodynamics ought to be understood primarily as complex biophysical phenomena: nested interactions, spanning multiple temporaland spatial scales and distributed across massively parallel modular hierarchies. The observable dynamics, both at a mesoscopic and microscopic scale, are the result of complex nonlinear interactions, the ensemble actions of very large and heterogeneous neuronal populations. These, shaped by evolutionary and developmental constraints and permanently subjected to functional re-organization, constitute very proficient adaptive processing systems. To a first approximation, this complex circuitry can be seen as large excitable reservoirs, whose symmetry-breaking inhomogeneities (present at multiple levels) naturally give rise to rich high-dimensional dynamics that supports cognitive function and computation. Furthermore, the intrinsic recurrent dynamics endows the system with fading memory, but places critical constraints on processing precision. Neural computation ought to be studied in context, accounting for the emergence of mental phenomena and thus guided and constrained by findings from the cognitive and behavioral sciences. These can provide tasks and computational specifications, as well as performance constraints while the necessary parallels between structure and function are gradually and systematically established. In this context, it is reasonable to study the implementation of different aspects of cognitive function that express themselves as temporal sequences given that they are ubiquitous in multiple cognitive domains (from sensorimotor sequencing to language processing). Interestingly, the cortical architecture and its underlying functional relations also appear to be highly sensitive to serial order and temporal structure. The ability to perceive statistically repeating spatiotemporal patterns and abstract the underlying rules may constitute a domain-general mechanism for the acquisition of predictive relations, as it allows for efficient generalization over compact representations. The ever-changing network of synaptic (and neuronal intrinsic) properties determines, on short to medium timescales, the ability of a circuit to process time-varying input in an active, predictive manner, dynamically patterned as transient sequences of network states which, through the orchestration of multiple plasticity mechanisms, come to reflect an increasingly restricted and accurate internal model of the relevant knowledge structure. Throughout this thesis, we propose to model the underlying systems (at various degrees of biological plausibility) in functional contexts, in order to gain knowledge about the system itself and the computational relevance of its internal features.

The biophysical reality, however, is radically different from a homogeneous system and multiple levels of complex heterogeneous properties co-exist and shape a local circuit’s emergent collective dynamics and information processing properties. Within each cortical module, the characteristic patterning of the microcircuit’s building blocks and their mechanistic interactions give rise to rich dynamics, which subserves local computation by shaping the spatiotemporal features of population responses. Despite their varying molecular, morphological and physiological features, cortical modules can be seen as variations on a common theme. In essence, notwithstanding the complex laminar patterning and differential input-output relations which might give rise to additional structural and functional sub-parcellations, cortical modules are large recurrently coupled neuronal networks, whose interactions are achieved primarily via spike-triggered excitatory and inhibitory transmission. The combined complexity of these heterogeneous building blocks can be leveraged by cortical microcircuits to provide a rich dynamical space where complex relational constructs, spanning multiple timescales, can be learned, represented and used for online information processing. In this study, we set out to systematically evaluate the role played by different sources of heterogeneity (structural, neuronal and synaptic) in the characteristics of population dynamics and the circuit’s capacity for online stimulus processing with fading memory, using cortical layer 2/3 microcircuits as a core inspiration for the circuit specification. We cross-reference various sources of experimental data regarding the composition and patterning of these microcircuits, accounting for different phenomena of interest (e.g. neuron types and corresponding sub-threshold characteristics, conductance properties of different receptor types, circuit-level connectivity and activity statistics, etc.), across different cortical regions, assuming a certain degree of generalization is possible. The methods applied in this study to quantify the dynamics and generic processing properties, being system-independent, can provide a valuable set of tools for microcircuit benchmarking. As carefully curated and organized datasets become increasingly available, it will become possible in the near future to apply increasingly realistic constrains and comparatively study the properties of realistic microcircuits, built to model specific cortical regions and input-output relations.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging heterogeneity for neural computation with fading memory","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Renato Duarte"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1476266400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577918688,"objectID":"9f921542da00161e341505a583d5aaae","permalink":"https://rcfduarte.github.io/talk/inm_retreat_2016/","publishdate":"2018-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/inm_retreat_2016/","section":"talk","summary":"Perceptual decision-making is an intricate process implicating the coordinated activity of multiple brain areas. Recent experimental studies demonstrate the existence of a complex interplay between decision-related neural events and transient working memory processes, implemented by distributed circuits where specific sub-populations appear to be differentially involved in the evidence accumulation process and subsequent behavioral outcomes. This results in observable divergences in choice-specific neuronal dynamics, unfolding as reproducible trajectories throughout the network’s state-space and hinting at the dissipative nature of the underlying dynamical system, which executes cognitively relevant processing through transient trajectories. Despite this evidence, the majority of modeling studies addressing reward-modulated decision-making tend to simplify the formalization of environmental representations in the cortex as stable, attractor states corresponding to discrete environmental states. Even models involving transient-based computations often simplify sensory stimuli to a discrete set of inputs transduced as stochastic point processes. These simplifications potentially draw an incomplete picture of neural dynamics and therefore provide limited insights into the true nature of computation in neural circuits. To overcome this issue, we take one step towards realistic in silico experimental settings by using structured virtual environments to obtain rich sensory input to drive model neural systems using the ROS-MUSIC toolchain. It allows us to simulate robotic agents in virtual 3D environments performing a realistic perceptual decision task, which can be directly equated to experimental data. The robotic simulation generates realistic and structured sensory data which is encoded to spiking neural activity using a nonlinear encoding process. The encoded sensory data is then used as input to a balance recurrent neural circuit. In this study, we investigate the emergent dynamical features of neural activity when the agent is navigating a virtual T-maze. We observe decision-specific sequences of neural activity akin to experimental evidence, revealing possible processing strategies employed by the neural substrate. Furthermore, we investigate the role of different adaptation/plasticity mechanisms in shaping the system’s dynamics. In order to equate our results with those of other studies, we attempt to partition the network state-space into discrete activity clusters, which carry relevant information that could potentially be used to drive reinforcement learning algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Decision-specific sequences of neural activity in balanced random networks driven by structured sensory input","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Philipp Weidel","Mikael Djurfeldt","Renato Duarte","Abigail Morrison"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575826201,"objectID":"7e71b3b71b3f6b663eb86d7a505057c4","permalink":"https://rcfduarte.github.io/publication/ros_music/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ros_music/","section":"publication","summary":"In order to properly assess the function and computational properties of simulated neural systems, it is necessary to account for the nature of the stimuli that drive the system.

However, the representation of these states that allows them to be associated with reward expectations remains unclear. Previous studies have tended to rely on pre-defined partitioning of states encoded by disjunct neuronal groups or sparse topological drives. A more likely scenario is that striatal neurons are involved in the encoding of multiple different states through their spike patterns, and that an appropriate partitioning of an environment is learned on the basis of task constraints, thus minimizing the number of states involved in solving a particular task. Here we show that striatal activity is sufficient to implement a liquid state, an important prerequisite for such a computation, whereby transient patterns of striatal activity are mapped onto the relevant states. We develop a simple small scale model of the striatum which can reproduce key features of the experimentally observed activity of the major cell types of the striatum. We then use the activity of this network as input for the supervised training of four simple linear readouts to learn three different functions on a plane, where the network is stimulated with the spike coded position of the agent. We discover that the network configuration that best reproduces striatal activity statistics lies on the edge of chaos and has good performance on all three tasks, but that in general, the edge of chaos is a poor predictor of network performance.","tags":["Striatum","Liquid State Machine","Edge of chaos","State representation","Generalization"],"title":"Liquid computing on and off the edge of chaos with a striatal microcircuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renato Duarte","Abigail Morrison"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1413936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575826201,"objectID":"c7b534073dfe0e58dc4d23e15ef1544e","permalink":"https://rcfduarte.github.io/publication/dynamicstability_frontiers2014/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dynamicstability_frontiers2014/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to acquire and maintain appropriate representations of time-varying, sequential stimulus events is a fundamental feature of neocortical circuits and a necessary first step toward more specialized information processing.

At various processing stages, from perceptual to motor, discrete structural elements with intricate temporal dependencies are combined into increasingly complex constructs. In order to address these issues and to attempt to map these complex processes to the underlying neuronal infrastructure, we adopt ideas and formalisms developed by theoretical linguistics to study the nature of rule-like or compositional behavior. The Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) paradigm has a long tradition as a means to study the nature of syntactic processing and implicit sequence learning. With mere exposure and without performance feedback, human beings implicitly acquire knowledge about the structural regularities implemented by complex rule systems. In this work, we investigate to which extent generic cortical microcircuits can support formally explicit symbolic computations, instantiated by formal grammars and implementing various types of local and non-adjacent dependencies between the sequence elements, thus requiring varying degrees of computational complexity and online processing memory to be adequately learned. We use concrete implementations of input-driven recurrent networks composed of noisy, spiking neurons, built according to the reservoir computing framework and dynamically shaped by a variety of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms operating concomitantly. We show that, when shaped by plasticity, these models are capable of acquiring the structure of simple (regular) grammars.

To account for the ability of neuronal circuits to process data with embedded temporal dependencies (expressed as symbolic time series), recurrent neural network (RNN) models are naturally suitable by virtue of their inherent recurrent connectivity (that allows context information to be kept in units’ activities), but also due to their biological plausibility. In this work, we explore the properties and characteristics of different recurrent network models, built according to the reservoir computing framework, involved in a series of different sequence processing tasks, designed to assess their ability to acquire and learn temporal dependencies and statistics of the input data. We assess their properties and performance as ‘predictive machines’ (relating it to the capacity to learn the set of generative rules underlying different grammars), and explore their ability to adequately capture and represent variable length temporal dependencies embedded in the input sequences.

The recent reservoir computing (RC) models, an extension of the RNN paradigm, provide a framework for state-dependent computations, where information is encoded in the form of state-space trajectories, which is similar to recent findings in neurobiology. Over the past few years, several attempts have been made to endow these network models with adaptive mechanisms, capable of mimicking the various neural plasticity mechanisms known to exist in the brain and to play a fundamental role in shaping the dynamics and information processing capabilities of the underlying neural networks. In this thesis, we analyze the dynamic properties of a simple reservoir computer model, with self-organizing plasticity mechanisms operating concomitantly. We investigate how different combinations of three forms of biologically inspired adaptive mechanisms shape the reservoir’s dynamic properties and their effectiveness in acquiring an internal representation of structured symbol sequences. We demonstrate, replicating previous work, that only combined do these mechanisms allow the dynamic reservoir networks to achieve an input separation that outperforms static (i.e. without plasticity) reservoir networks. We further assess how the symbol sequences are internally represented in different network settings. All reservoir networks are shown to reflect the input structure in their state dynamics, but plasticity is clearly beneficial by modifying network parameters, increasing the network’s ability to learn the temporal structure of the input sequences.","tags":["Recurrent Neural Networks","Reservoir Computing","Plasticity","Self-organization","Sequence processing"],"title":"Self-organized sequence processing in recurrent neural networks with multiple interacting plasticity mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575826201,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://rcfduarte.github.io/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572369978,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://rcfduarte.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
